        <h1>TRS</h1>

        <p style="font-weight: bold">TRS is an open-source recipe for organizing a master-level robotics project. It relies on a cross-platform robot development and simulation environment that can be installed in five minutes and that allows students to write control, navigation, vision or manipulation algorithms in a hundred lines of Matlab or Python code. TRS contains a project structure (documentation, objectives, milestones), and the software skeleton for running the project (simulator models, Matlab code examples, install instructions). It is freely available and extendable.</p>

        <p>Because working with hardware is time-consuming, many Master-level and PhD-level robotics courses leave hardware issues aside, to give the students time to study theoretical concepts and information-processing algorithms. Unfortunately, hardware-free courses often come with no hands-on exercises, which impedes learning. Here, we consider one solution to this problem: allowing students to gain practical experience in a simulated environment. Open-source simulators have existed for a long time, but their limited ease-of-use made them impractical for teaching. Ease of use is crucial in teaching: The software must be robust, multi-platform, and its installation has to be trivial. <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com">V-REP</a>, the simulator on which TRS is based, can be installed on Linux, OSX and Windows simply by uncompressing zip archive.</p>

        <p>Software development is another major challenge in robot development. TRS is based on the <a href="http://petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html">Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB</a> (RTB), a library of robot-oriented software building blocks. Its Matlab implementation makes it accessible to branches of engineering where fluency in C++ is not expected.</p>

        <p>TRS is an environment, based on V-REP and RTB, that allows students to control a robot from Matlab. The environment consists of a set of Matlab scripts, and a V-REP file modeling a mobile robot and a building floor. Running a single Matlab command establishes a connection between Matlab and V-REP. The user is then able to recover sensor data (images, scans, odometry), process those data, and send commands to the robot's actuators.</p>

        <p>An understanding of the simulator itself is not required, as all the programming is done through the Matlab interface.</p>

        <p>The TRS recipe is freely distributed via a <a href="https://github.com/ULgRobotics/trs">GitHub repository</a>
