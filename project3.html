<h1 style="margin-top: 0">Description</h1>

<p>The goal of the third EMOR tutorial is to write a program enabling youBot to <b>navigate</b>.
This task is broken into three subtasks:
<ol>
  <li>generation of random, yet collision-less trajectory (without any destination)</li>
  <li>navigation to the destination without the use of map</li>
  <li>using map for planning of a colision-less trajectory to the destination</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly to the previous tutorial, you should write your program on the basis of <code>exercise03.m</code> script, by modifying the section between the
<b>% EMOR exercise begin</b> and <b>% EMOR exercise end</b> comments.

<p>And analogically, we also prepared a simulation environment in V-REP stored in file <code>exercise03.ttt</code>.
<b>You must run it before running your matlab script</b>.


<p>The environment used for this task (presented on the left side) was generated from the binary image, with white pixels representing obstacles (presented on the right).
The image is of size 30px x 30px, whereas the map is of size 15m x 15m.
<p>

<img style="border: 1px solid black; height: 250px" src="raster/tut_03_map.png" alt="map" />



<a id="random" name="random"></a>
<h2>Generation of random motion</h2>

You should write a program that:
<ol>
  <li> Moves the robot ahead (i.e. along the same orientation) until some of obstacles are near (e.g. in a distance smaller than 0.5m) </li>
  <li> Randomly selects new the orientation (e.g. from (30, 330) degrees) </li>
  <li> Rotates the robot so his orientation is the same as the randomly chosen one and starts to move ahead (enters the state from the first point)</li>
</ol>
As a result the robot should randomly "visit" different parts of the map, without colliding with obstacles.


<a id="bug2" name="bug2"></a>
<h2>Navigation to the place of destination with Bug2</h2>

Write a program implementing the Bug2 algorithm. The basic idea is to move along the line connecting the target and initial point and in the case of being near to the obstacle follow its contour and thus circumnavigate it.
The program should work as follows:
<ol>
  <li> Find the line connecting initial and target position </li>
  <li> Rotate towards the goal </li>
  <li> Move towards the goal until reaching an obstacle </li>
  <li> Use "following the wall" algorith to avoid the obstacje and depart immediately when it is able to move directly toward the goal (when crosses the "original" line once again). </li>
</ol>


<a id="wavefront" name="wavefront"></a>
<h2>Path planning with Wavefront</h2>
This algorithm is responsible for finding the optimal route to the goal in the planning phase, i.e. before leaving the initial pose.
For this purpose it analyses the map and generates the path and in an off-line manner.
When finished, the robot simply follows the generated path.
The generation of the path works as follows:
<ol>
  <li> Set the cost of target position (cell) to 0 </li>
  <li> For a given cell (neighbouring with cells with assigned cost) find the neighbour with lowest cost lc, set cost of the currently analyzed cell to lc+1 </li>
  <li> Repeat step 2 for each cell until all cells (including the initial one) have assigned costs </li>
  <li> Find the path starting from the initial cell to the destination, by selecting the neighbouring cell with the smallest cost</li>
</ol>
More detailed description of the Wavefront can be found in the EMOR lectures, as well as on <a href="http://www.societyofrobots.com/programming_wavefront.shtml">this website</a>.




<h2 style="margin-top: 0">Grading  (13p total)</h2>
<ol>

  	<li>Moving the robot ahead  until an obstacle enters the "dangerous zone" (1p)</li>

	</ol>

	<ol>
  	<li>Loading and proper "rescaling" the map from map.png file (1p)</li>
  	<li>Implementation of the "Wavefront"-based path generation (3p)</li>
  	<li>Visualization of the generated path in the V-REP (1p)</li>
  	<li>Realization of the navigation on the basis of the generated path (1p)</li>
	</ol>

</ol>


<p><b>Important:</b> You must modify only the indicated section of the <code>exercise03.m</code> script. Modification of other parts of the code are forbidden and will result in zero points for the project. 

<h2>Requirements</h2>
The robot is supposed to move in diverse environments.
For this purposes we prepared three environment files, along with three maps.
You can download them from the following links:
<ol>
<li> File <a href="https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/emor_trs/blob/master/youbot/map_test1.png">map_test1.png</a> containing the map along with the related file <a href="https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/emor_trs/blob/master/youbot/exercise03_test1.ttt">exercise03_test1.ttt</a> containing the simulation environment </li>
<li> File <a href="https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/emor_trs/blob/master/youbot/map_test2.png">map_test2.png</a> containing the map along with the related file <a href="https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/emor_trs/blob/master/youbot/exercise03_test2.ttt">exercise03_test2.ttt</a> containing the simulation environment </li>
</ol>
In order to get the maximum number of points the robot must succesfully navigate in all environments.

<p><b>Important:</b> We also added the <b>Graph</b> object, responsible for drawing the robots path, to the original environment.
You can download the updated version <a href="https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/emor_trs/blob/master/youbot/exercise03.ttt">of exercise03.ttt from here</a>!


<h2>Programming hints</h2>

The motion of the robot should be controlled by variables representing the relative velocities:
<ol>
  <li><code>forwBackVel</code> - linear velocity along the x axis of the robot [m/s] </li>
  <li><code>leftRightVel</code> - linear velocity along the y axis of the robot [m/s] </li>
  <li><code>rotVel</code> - angular velocity around the z axis of the robot [rad/s] </li>
</ol>

Additionally, you should gather and analyse data from the lidar sensors. There are two variables returned by the function:
<ol>
  <li><code>pts</code> - a table containing readings i.e. contact points,  in sensor's coordinates, each expressed as [x;y;z] </li>
  <li><code>contacts</code> - a table of values <0/1> determining whether an obstactle was detected or the reading corresponds to the maximal sensor range (in this case it is set to 5m) </li>
</ol>
