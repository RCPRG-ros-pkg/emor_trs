The values t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 and t6 are multipliers for grades of tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. After each deadline the multipliers change as shown in the table. Thus, the maximum scores for tasks are discounted as the next deadlines pass, e.g. the score for **task 3** before missing the **deadline 4** is multiplied by *0.6* and after missing the **deadline 4** is multiplied by *0.4*.
