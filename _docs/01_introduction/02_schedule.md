The values t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 and t6 are multipliers for grades of tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. After each deadline the multipliers change as shown in the table. Thus, the maximum scores for tasks are discounted as the next deadlines pass, e.g. the score for **task 3** before missing the **deadline 4** is multiplied by *0.6* and after missing the **deadline 4** is multiplied by *0.4*.


## Consultations

Consultations are:
* non obligatory individual meetings (or group meetings, if there are more students interested in a particular topic)
* on Fridays, 10:15-12:00.
* held in room P109 in the basement

If you cannot attend during the scheduled dates, you can contact the tutor through e-mail (please see the [Contact]({{site.baseurl}}/01_introduction/03_contact){:target="_blank"} page).


## Deadlines

Deadlines are on Wednesdays at 23:59 (please send your solutions via e-mail). Missing a deadline results in lower grades according to t1 - t6 values in the table.
