brief: About the tasks.

Each task is a [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab){:target="_blank"} program that controls a mobile robot: [KUKA YouBot](https://spectrum.ieee.org/scoop-kukas-youbot){:target="_blank"}. The program should use the data from various sensors to control the velocities of the robot base wheels to realize the specified task.

The robot is controlled in a simulated environment inside the [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/){:target="_blank"} simulator. The Matlab program that controls the youBot robot communicates with the simulated hardware using CoppeliaSim Matlab bindings. The control program may use API functions from [Peter Corke's Robotics, Vision and Control toolkit](https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/){:target="_blank"}.

The students should run the simulator and Matlab on their own laptops, as some of the work is intended to be done as homework. Linux, Windows and Mac OS operating systems are supported.

Please refer to a page that explains how to setup a laptop to work on the course.

Some informative examples of robot control programs are presented in the *Example task page*.

More detailed information on each task is provided on the individual pages of the tasks.
